        <h1 style="color: white;">History of Bubble Tea!</h1>
        <p>Bubble tea first originated in Taiwan, specifically in the Taichung/Tainan area in the 1980s. Having something solid inside drinks was uncommon until
            tapioca pearls were somehow added to a milk tea drink, and that's when bubble tea was born. Bubble tea has attracted the attention of many people throughout the world.</p>
